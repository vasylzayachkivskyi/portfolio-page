                    Golden Stars Little Chef Program is a science-based program where children get to make their
                    own snacks and lunches. It boosts their creativity and self-confidence and introduces them to
                    healthy food options. It's once a week led by our educators who teach the kids how to make
                    things like 'poppers' or 'pizza bites.'
                    The child will then be able to enjoy what they made themselves with some fresh vegetables for
                    dipping! This program gives them skills in cooking, and helps develop an understanding of
                    portion control and the importance of eating balanced meals.

                Children who attend preschool are more likely to be successful in kindergarten. They are better
                prepared for the academic demands of school and have developed social skills that help them
                adjust to a new environment.

                  Golden Stars Sleep Therapy for Children is a program designed to help children sleep better. It
                  includes a comprehensive package of strategies and tools that parents can administer at home
                  with their children, as well as coaching sessions with an experienced sleep coach.
                  The Golden Stars Program is grounded in the science of pediatric sleep medicine and has been
                  shown to be effective in improving overall health, behavior, academics, moods and emotions, as
                  well as family wellness. Our approach recognizes that all aspects of development are
                  interconnected – physical, cognitive, social-emotional – so it’s essential to provide a holistic
                  perspective on how kids learn best.
                  The result? Kids who feel more rested and ready for life

                  Golden Stars Music Therapy for Children Program is a music-based therapy designed to help
                  children develop their mental, emotional and physical health. It focuses on developing these
                  skills in 3 key areas:
                  <ul>
                    <li> · Self-Esteem and Wellbeing</li>
                    <li> · Cognition and Language Development</li>
                    <li> · Motor Skills and Movement Control</li>
                  </ul>
                  The program operates under the belief that by focusing on these three areas of development, we
                  can help kids overcome developmental delays or disabilities, such as autism spectrum disorder
                  (ASD).
                  The Golden Stars Music Therapy Program provides individualized sessions based on what they
                  need at that time to improve their abilities in each area of development while also helping them

                  Painting is an important skill for life because it can help people express themselves and
                  communicate ideas more effectively.
                  It also shapes how the brain operates by stimulating neurons and increasing cognitive skills like

                  because it helps them learn skills like creativity, problem solving and critical thinking.
                  The clay allows children to experience the satisfaction of creating something out of nothing--and
